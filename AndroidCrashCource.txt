Finally, you are able (to use the IDE, but also) to compile an app, start the emulator and deploy an app via the commandline: 

a) set environment variables and startup tools
    
Basic Tools: 
        Studio, emulator/avd, API-Levels/Versions, gradle fÃ¼r module=app
        Filesystem/pathes (PATH, ANDROID_SDK_ROOT) to easily start emulator, gradlew, adb/am

b) Understand how an app is structured and compile, sign, package an app into an apk
 
Apps: 
hello world versus (https://github.com/android/sunflower)
        res: manifest, layout/xml (Design/Code-View), strings.xml, Activity/Fragment
        code: findViewById, setOnClickListener, Log.i
        imports: androidx.navigation / databinding
        fs: Kotlin => tmp/kotlin-classes/*.class
        fs: Databinding => code "findById" generated .. see build-folder/.../FragmentFirstBinding.java)

c) Deploy and start an app on the emulator

Advanced Tool Usage: 
        fs: intermediates/apk/debug/app-debug.apk 
        inspect apk using Android Studio
        Studiou/debug, 
        commandline/adb
        use scrcpy (https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) to remote view/control (an app on) your device
